### Good Converter

Santa's list-making system needs an upgrade! Here's an initial type definition provided:

```typescript
type AppendGood<T> = unknown;
```

Your task is to create a TypeScript generic type `AppendGood<T>` that transforms an object type `T` by appending `'good_'` prefix to each property key while keeping the original property values intact.

Good luck and happy coding!
