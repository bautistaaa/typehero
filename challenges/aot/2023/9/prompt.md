### Is Santa Dyslexic?

Santa's workshop needs a TypeScript type to reverse the names of his reindeer! There's a starter type defined as follows:

```typescript
type Reverse<S> = unknown;
```

Your task is to create a TypeScript type named `Reverse<S>` that reverses the given string `S`. The type should be able to reverse the names of Santa's reindeer, following these rules:

- `'rehsaD'` should be transformed into `'Dasher'`
- `'recnaD'` should be transformed into `'Dancer'`
- `'recnarP'` should be transformed into `'Prancer'`
- `'nexiV'` should be transformed into `'Vixen'`
- `'temoC'` should be transformed into `'Comet'`
- `'dipuC'` should be transformed into `'Cupid'`
- `'rennoD'` should be transformed into `'Donner'`
- `'neztilB'` should be transformed into `'Blitzen'`
- `'hploduR'` should be transformed into `'Rudolph'`

Good luck!
