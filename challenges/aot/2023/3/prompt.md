### Christmas Cookie Inventory

Santa's workshop has a cookie inventory! The elves have been keeping track of various cookie types and their quantities. Now, Santa needs your help to create a TypeScript type that extracts the names of all the different types of cookies from the inventory.

```typescript
const cookieInventory = {
  chocolate: 1,
  sugar: 20,
  gingerBread: 10,
  peanutButter: 30,
  snickeDoodle: 73,
};
```

Your task is to define a TypeScript type named `CookieSurveyInput` that extracts the names of the cookie types from the `cookieInventory` object.

Good luck!
