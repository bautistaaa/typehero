### Naughty List Decipher

Santa needs a TypeScript type to help decipher his naughty list! He's enlisted your help by providing an initial type template:

```typescript
type DecipherNaughtyList<S extends string> = unknown;
```

Your task is to create a TypeScript type named `DecipherNaughtyList` that takes a string `S` and extracts individual names from it. The string consists of names separated by slashes ('/'). The type should output a union of these individual names as strings.


Good luck, and happy decoding Santa's naughty list!
