### Santa's Remaining Deliveries

Santa needs your help to count the number of presents he still has to deliver in his hood! He's got presents 🎁 to deliver, some socks 🧦 that he received in return, and occasionally, Christmas trees 🎄 in his hood.

Here's the initial type setup you'll work with:

```typescript
type Count<T, U> = unknown;
```

Your task is to create a TypeScript type `Count<T, U>` that calculates the number of specific items (🎁 | 🧦 | 🎄) present in Santa's hood represented by an array of items (`T`).

Can you create the `Count<T, U>` type that accurately counts the specified items in Santa's hoods to pass the test cases provided?

Good luck!
