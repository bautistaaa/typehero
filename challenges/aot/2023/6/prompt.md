### Christmas Naughty Children Filtering Puzzle

Santa's workshop needs your help to filter out the naughty children from the nice ones using TypeScript! An initial type `RemoveNaughtyChildren` has been set up:

```typescript
type RemoveNaughtyChildren<T, U> = unknown;
```

Can you create the `RemoveNaughtyChildren` type that accurately filters out instances of `'naughty'` from a union type? 

**Note: Santa may want to remove any type of children if he so chooses so make sure you account for any type of child!**

Good luck!
