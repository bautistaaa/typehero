### Santa Got Lost Again

Santa is lost in a forest of Christmas trees! Your task is to help find Santa's location in various forests. To assist in this search, you'll need to create a TypeScript type named `FindSanta<T>`.

Here's the initial code you'll start with:

```typescript
type FindSanta<T, U> = unknown;
```

The task is to define the `FindSanta` type, which, when given a forest grid, will determine Santa's position and return it as a tuple `[rowIndex, columnIndex]`.

Good luck and happy forest searching!
