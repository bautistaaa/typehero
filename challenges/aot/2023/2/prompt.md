## The Gift Wrapper

Did you know that there's also monetary inflation at the North Pole? You betcha, there is. And after 200+ years without a pay raise, the Santa's elves are beginning to discuss a general strike.

December 2nd is just about the worst time imaginable for such a strike, and Santa's desparate to calm the elves down. If he can just wrap a few presents maybe the elves will forget that they're being paid well below market rate (don't worry: the North Pole's actually still a Deleware-based startup so therefore it's ok).

There's a `GiftWrapper` type to help keep the wrapping process organized, but it needs something... it needs some way to be paramaterized. What we have so far is nice as a _generic_ (\*wink wink\*) starting point... but it needs some way to provide specific values for `Present`, `From`, and `To` at the type layer..

Please help! Otherwise the reindeer might catch wind of this and start a striek of their own in solidarity with the elves!
