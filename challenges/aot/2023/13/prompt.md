### Count the Days

In the spirit of counting down to Christmas, Santa needs a special type that can count the days until Christmas or the days of the Twelve Days of Christmas! Currently, there's a type defined as follows:

```typescript
type DayCounter<L, H> = unknown;
```

Can you create the `DayCounter` type that satisfies the test cases?

Good luck and happy coding!
